# CompositeVideo_to_png
MAIN GOAL:
Convert NES (Nintendo Entertainment System) composite video data from an oscilloscope (in csv file format) of one "field" (frame) to an image file.

This will be used as a debugger for a larger project that will demodulate composite video for additional processing in realtime.
