# CompositeVideo_to_png
MAIN GOAL:
Convert composite video data from an oscilloscope (in csv file format) of one "field" to an image file.

This will be used as a debugger for a larger project that will demodulate composite video for additional processing in realtime.

FIRST STEP:
DrawASingleLine.py is my first attempt at drawing a single scanline from a manually trimmed csv file so that I did not have to find the horizontal sync pulse.


More to come.
