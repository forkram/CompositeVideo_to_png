# CompositeVideo_to_png
Taking composite video data in csv file format from an oscilloscope and converting one field of data to an image file.
DrawASingleLine.py is my first attempt at drawing a single scanline from a manually trimmed csv file so that I did not have to find the horizontal sync pulse.
More to come.
